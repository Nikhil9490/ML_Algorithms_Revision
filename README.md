# ML_Algorithms_Revision

This repository contains the notebook files of all ML algorithms I revised. As a AI grad student graduating in Dec 2025, I am preparing for my interviews in the field of AI and data science. I feel that revising all concepts starting from basic machine learning techniques to complex deep learning techniques is one pathway to follow.
